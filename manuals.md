## About the List

This is a list of articles and books teaching web scraping.

### Base Things

To know base things is more important than to know particular tools or implementations.

It is important to know what is HTTP, TCP, TLS, DNS, HTML, XML, XPath, CSS, DOM, proxying network requests.

It is LESS important to know how to build crawler with SuperScrapingFramework or what function of PowerfulHTMLParsingLibrary allows
you to extract text from selected element of HTML DOM tree. These things are very specific. You do not have to know how to operate
with every scraping framework or HTML parsing package in the world. If you know base things it is just a matter of short time
to get knowledge about how to operate this base things with a particular programming package.

### Information Availability

The list must provide information which is accessable instantly. The list does not accept books whose content are not available online.

### Information Granularity

If a book contains a number of topics, it makes sense to refer to particular topic of the book in a particular section of
Learning Web Scraping list.

### How to Contribute

You may submit a new issue with an article or book you want to add. I will read the article or take a look at animals on
a cover picture of the book and will decide is it worth to be included in the list.
